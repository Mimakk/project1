First of all you need python just go and download python.

For the best practice you need to build a virtual environment

    pip install virtualenv

After installing virtualenv you can build your environment

    virtualenv <your_environment_name> 

Then, acctivate tour environment

    source <your_environment_name>/bin/activate

After that, you must install requirements
